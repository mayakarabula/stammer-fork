# _stammer_ &mdash; an interface library for small spacecraft

This project is in a very a messy work-in-progress situation.
The current state is utterly useless and actively bad.
Do not use this.

This project started as a way of breaking out the ui/rendering code for [_tid_](https://git.sr.ht/~ma3ke/tid/) and [_gemininini_](https://github.com/mayakarabula/gemininini/).
In the future, it _may_ be used as their ui backend. Or not. We'll see.

_stammer_ is part of the broader [_weft_](https://sr.ht/~ma3ke/weft) ecosystem.
