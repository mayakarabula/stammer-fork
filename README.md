# _stammer_ &mdash; an interface library for small spacecraft

This project is in a very a messy work-in-progress situation.
The current state is utterly useless and actively bad.
Do not use this.

This project started as a way of breaking out the ui/rendering code for [_tid_](https://git.sr.ht/~ma3ke/tid/) and [_gemininini_](https://github.com/mayakarabula/gemininini/).
In the future, it _may_ be used as their ui backend. Or not. We'll see.

## contributing

_**NOTE:** If you would like to submit changes, but feel intimidated by doing it by email, that is no problem at all!
Another fine way is to fork the repository elsewhere, push your changes to there, and send me the link to the commit you want me to consider.
Or, just get in touch with a DM or email :)_

Patches can be submitted to `~ma3ke/public-inbox@lists.sr.ht`.
The archives can be found at [lists.sr.ht/~ma3ke/public-inbox](https://lists.sr.ht/~ma3ke/public-inbox).

When submitting a patch via email, please set the subject prefix to `PATCH stammer`, by running the following command.

```
git config format.subjectPrefix "PATCH stammer"
```

(If you don't know how this stuff works, but want to learn about this, [git-send-email.io](https://git-send-email.io/) is a fantastic hands-on resource.)
